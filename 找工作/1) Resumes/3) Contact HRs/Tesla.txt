Dear Tesla Motors,
This is Chung-Hau Wang. I graduated with master degree in December 2013 from the University of Southern California majoring in mechanical engineering and specifying in design and control. Now I am in the OPT status and looking for full-time and/or internship opportunities in Design, Engineering, and/or Manufacturing categories.

I have had rich experience in SolidWorks and AutoCAD, and have used SolidWorks to do modeling and finite element analysis (FEA); and I have had experience in vehicle design. Although you need skills in CATIA, I still think I can catch up very quickly basing on my experience in SolidWorks. I am eager to give it a try. Hope I can get the chance. Here, I attach a link of my Linkedin profile. Looking forward to hearing good news from you. Thank you.
