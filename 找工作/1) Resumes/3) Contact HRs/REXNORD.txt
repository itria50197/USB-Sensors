Dear Melody Robertson,
This is Chung-Hau Wang. I graduated with master degree in December 2013 from the University of Southern California majoring in mechanical engineering and specifying in design and control. Now I am in the OPT status and looking for full-time and/or internship opportunities in Design, Engineering, and/or Manufacturing categories.

I have had rich experience in SolidWorks and AutoCAD, and have used SolidWorks to do modeling and finite element analysis (FEA); and I have also had experience in engineering design. Although you prefer skills in CATIA and/or Pro-E, I still think I can catch up very quickly basing on my experience in SolidWorks. I am eager to give it a try and would like to talk about myself more with you. Hope you have a quick look through my resume and give me a chance. I have applied for the position at Mechanical Design Engineer, and here I still attach a link of my Linkedin profile. Looking forward to hearing good news from you. Thank you.
